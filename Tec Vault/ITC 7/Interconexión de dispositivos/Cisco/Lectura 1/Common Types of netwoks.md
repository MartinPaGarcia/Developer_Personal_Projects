# Common Types of networks

As you may know, networks come in all sizes. They range from simple networks consisting of 2 computers, to the ones that connect millions of devices.

Small office and home office (SOHO) networks allow people to work from home. 
Businesses and large organizations use networks to provide consolidation, sotrage, and access to information servers. Many organizations use their own network's to the internet provide products to their customers

# LANS and WANS

Network infrastructures vary greatly in their terms of:

* Size of the area covered
* Number of users connected
* Number and types of services available
* Area of responsability

The 2 most common types of network infrastructure are Local Area Networks (LANs), and Wide Area Networks (WANs). LAN provides access to users and end devices in a small geographical area, while WAN provides access to the networks of a large geographical area, which is often owned and managed by a larger corporation or a telecommunication service provider. The figure below shows a LAN connected to a WAN.**

# Intranet and Extranets

There are terms which are similar to the term internet: Intranet and Extranet.

Intranet is a term often used to refer to a private connection of LAN'S and WAN's. The intranet is designed to be accessible only by the organization's members/employes or others with auth.

An organization may use extranet to provide secure connection and safe access to individuals who work for a different organization, but require access to the organization's data. Here are some examples:

* A company that is providing access to outside suppliers.
* A hospital that is providing a booking system to doctors.
