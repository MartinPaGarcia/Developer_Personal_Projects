# Network representations

As you may know, network architects must be able to show how the network will look like. They need to be able to detect all the components, such as where are they located, and how they will be connected. The diagrams of networks often use symbols such as the one in the figure below to represent all the different devices and the connections that make up a network.

A diagram must provide an easy way to understand how the devices connect to a large network. This type of "picture" of a network is known as a topology diagram, and the ability to recognize the logical representations of these types of diagrams is key to be able to visualize the organization operation of a network.

Furthermore these representations terminology is used to describe how devices and media are connected to each other:

* Network Interface Card (NIC) - A NIC  physically connects the end device to the network.
* Physical Port -  A connector on a networking device  where the media connects to an end device.
* Interface - Specialized ports on a networking device that connect to individual networks.

> [!info] The terms port and interafce are often used interchangeably


# Topology Diagrams

These type of diagrams are mandatory for documentation for anyone working with a network. They provide a visual representation of how the network is connected. There are *two* types of topology diagrams: Physical and Logical.

## Physical Topology Diagrams 

These diagrams illustrate the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installations, as shown in the figure below.

## Logical Topology Diagrams

These diagrams illustrate devices, ports, and the addressing scheme of a network, as shown in the figure below.
